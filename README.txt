This is the first website I created before I attended the Iron yard. I was capable to understand HTML5, CSS3, and javascript to edit and add to the template website. I made it reponsive. All images and art (excluding featured artist) were created by me either by painting, creating image in photoshop or indesign. Pretty coooooool!
